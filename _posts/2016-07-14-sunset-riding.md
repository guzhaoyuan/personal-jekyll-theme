We live in the cross junction of West Dodrige Street and Olentangy River. So many car passes in front of our dorm and it is really noisy at night. So you have to close the windows tightly to cut off the noise.<br>
It was Tuesday and the first week that I arrived Columbus. We were going to a Chinese Shop called 华欣 to get some food for our meals. So we decided on Tuesday's evening and ride together there.<br>
The routine was heading North along the river. It was really a fantastic experience to riding along the River in Columbus in the evening(even though I was exausted and sweaty)<br>
People here in Columbus like to exercise a lot. You can see so many people walking, jogging and riding everywhere(especially alongside the river). The life style seems to be very healthy and comfortable. I really love the pattern of people's life in western country. For example, Germany love to ride bikes and even agedness ride to everywhere. So they bring their bikes on to subways and buses. This is unimaginable in China.<br>
We bought meat with low price, and bagged them back home. My tyre was not air enough. It was really tiring to pedal my bike. I cannot catch up with my roommates because I have to take a rest every several minutes. I am totally wet when I got home.<br>
What makes the travel more interesting is that we accidently head into a forest to take a short cut. There were so many mosquitos and other inserts. We had to give up forging ahead because of the river blocked our way. Anyway, this is a amazing trip to ride in the sun set of Columbus.

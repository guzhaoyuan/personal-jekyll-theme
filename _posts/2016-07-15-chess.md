This Friday shows that I have been America for one week. And this gives me a sense of pressure. I have not seen Prof.Su yet, but I need to show him a prototype when he comes back. So I will need to stay in lab for weekends and 3D Print my components. I am really unconfident that I may not be able to make it.<br>
My senior fellows are very kind. They offered me a free bike and drove me to downtown. I feel really happy to collaborate with them. But my job was a little bit boring because I just sit there and drawing solidworks all day long.<br>
What makes me unconfortable is my diet. I think we are too abstemious. We only buy food that sales. We have little meat and eat lots of vegetable. I am a predator. I need meat and I do not care about money so much.<br>
What is more dispointing is that I do not have many chance to communicate with foreigners, so I have little chance to practice my oral English. In fact, I use Chinese both in Lab and in Apartment, That's a pity.

From now on, I will force myself to write something in English everyday to practive my writing skill. I realized that my English ability is really awful and to prepare for my English test in the near future, I need to adopt some constructive methods and make full preparation.

My topic will include all kinds of stuff concerning of my life and when there is no topic, I will translate reports on newspaper and talk about my perspective. Or write note about professional papers.

The number of words should no less than 200 and I will be causious about the spelling and grammar.

For today, I would like to release myself from stress because I really get a bad score for this semester, I did not spent enough time, but I really worked hard in revising and practising at the end of this term. I was so sad that compulsory class like Engineering Material, Mechanics of Meterial got suck low scores. It's all my fault and there is no returning. I feel terrible. But I have to be strong and positive. At least, I have much more important job waiting for me so I can not let awful mood bother me. I need to be ready for the coming challenge and no barrier should get in my way.
